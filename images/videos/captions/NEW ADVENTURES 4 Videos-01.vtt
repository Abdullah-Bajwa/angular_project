WEBVTT

1
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:12.993
He's here.

2
00:00:13.017 --> 00:00:15.017
Where, Mr. Thorne?

3
00:00:18.012 --> 00:00:20.981
Huh? Ah! There!

4
00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:22.015
I-I-I saw him!

5
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.006
Clink What? What's that?

6
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.022
Take him!

7
00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:53.989
Uh. Okay.

8
00:00:54.013 --> 00:00:58.004
Uh, we split the take, 30-70.

9
00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:01.019
Fifty-fifty.

10
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.006
Aah.

11
00:01:08.004 --> 00:01:09.011
Uh, ah!

12
00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:12.003
Ah!

13
00:01:13.014 --> 00:01:14.019
Uhh!

14
00:01:19.013 --> 00:01:19.994
Uh-ha.

15
00:01:20.018 --> 00:01:22.980
How-how'd you do that?

16
00:01:23.004 --> 00:01:24.016
I'm the Batman.

17
00:02:15.004 --> 00:02:17.014
♪ The Batman ♪

18
00:03:12.012 --> 00:03:13.022
whoosh.

19
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.010
Surprise.

20
00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:26.022
I'm touched, Alfred

21
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.989
but my birthday
isn't until October.

22
00:03:29.013 --> 00:03:30.999
It's an anniversary,
Master Bruce.

23
00:03:31.023 --> 00:03:35.022
Three years ago tonight, you
first donned cape and cowl.

24
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.989
Crime flies.

25
00:03:37.013 --> 00:03:38.996
Chop-chop. Make a wish.

26
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.014
I wish, I wish..

27
00:03:46.021 --> 00:03:49.987
I wish they were here,
too. Very much so.

28
00:03:50.011 --> 00:03:53.013
To the memory of
Thomas and Martha Wayne.

29
00:03:56.006 --> 00:03:59.010
The reason I became the Batman.

30
00:04:04.003 --> 00:04:05.990
'Chief Rojas, can
you verify rumors'

31
00:04:06.014 --> 00:04:07.983
'that it was the Batman
who apprehended'

32
00:04:08.007 --> 00:04:10.978
'crime boss Rupert Thorne
and his gang last night?'

33
00:04:11.002 --> 00:04:14.990
Do you know of anyone who's
actually seen this Batman?

34
00:04:15.014 --> 00:04:18.982
Because he's what's
called an Urban Legend.

35
00:04:19.006 --> 00:04:21.016
Why that cheeky..

36
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.987
- Bran flakes, sir.
- Easy, Alfred.

37
00:04:26.011 --> 00:04:26.999
The Batman's
right where he likes

38
00:04:27.023 --> 00:04:28.994
hovering below the radar.

39
00:04:29.018 --> 00:04:32.022
You are not one to bask
in glory, Master Bruce.

40
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.986
Well, there you have it.

41
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.991
In only three years
time, our crime rate

42
00:04:36.015 --> 00:04:38.980
has plummeted
to a nationwide low

43
00:04:39.004 --> 00:04:39.995
thanks to Gotham's finest.

44
00:04:40.019 --> 00:04:41.978
Back to you, Jim.

45
00:04:42.002 --> 00:04:42.998
Next up, billionaire Bruce Wayne

46
00:04:43.022 --> 00:04:44.990
contributes an unprecedented sum

47
00:04:45.014 --> 00:04:46.985
to Gotham's children's hospital.

48
00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:48.988
And in sports, the Gators
kick off a new season

49
00:04:49.012 --> 00:04:51.022
with tonight's home game.

50
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:55.981
Which billionaire Bruce
Wayne will be there to enjoy.

51
00:04:56.005 --> 00:04:57.999
Your season tickets, sir.

52
00:04:58.023 --> 00:05:00.987
Oh, to-tonight? Oh, but I had..

53
00:05:01.011 --> 00:05:03.979
Work to do in the Batcave?

54
00:05:04.003 --> 00:05:06.995
For the Batman to better
remain below the radar

55
00:05:07.019 --> 00:05:11.001
Bruce Wayne must
occasionally venture above it.

56
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.985
Get anything on our
vigilante this time, Bennett?

57
00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:22.449
Besides the fact
that he bat-wrapped.

58
00:05:23.001 --> 00:05:23.990
Thorne's butt for us?

59
00:05:24.014 --> 00:05:25.993
Well, it's up to you and
your partner to see to it

60
00:05:26.017 --> 00:05:28.991
that this Urban Legend
doesn't become a folk hero.

61
00:05:29.015 --> 00:05:30.985
Partner? Since when?

62
00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:34.022
Since I decided two
heads are better than one.

63
00:05:37.004 --> 00:05:38.998
Detective Ethan Bennett,
meet Detective Ellen Yin

64
00:05:39.022 --> 00:05:40.996
formally of Metropolis PD.

65
00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.022
- Their loss.
- Howdy, partner.

66
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.988
Welcome to Gotham.

67
00:05:47.012 --> 00:05:48.987
Now that you two are acquainted

68
00:05:49.011 --> 00:05:53.004
bring me this
Batman, whoever he is.

69
00:06:02.003 --> 00:06:03.013
'Ahem.'

70
00:06:05.004 --> 00:06:05.996
I know, Alfred.

71
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.981
Time for swinging
Bachelor Bruce Wayne

72
00:06:09.005 --> 00:06:09.990
to put on the party hat.

73
00:06:10.014 --> 00:06:11.990
Rest assured, Master Bruce.

74
00:06:12.014 --> 00:06:13.993
You're never far
from the Batcave

75
00:06:14.017 --> 00:06:17.007
with the modern
miracle of Batwave.

76
00:06:28.016 --> 00:06:31.021
Steiner, check.

77
00:06:34.001 --> 00:06:36.005
McSwain, check.

78
00:06:37.014 --> 00:06:39.020
223, vacant.

79
00:06:42.011 --> 00:06:43.993
Hey.

80
00:06:44.017 --> 00:06:47.988
No one logged any new arrivals.

81
00:06:48.012 --> 00:06:49.992
Whoa.

82
00:06:50.016 --> 00:06:52.006
What are you doing in here?

83
00:06:53.017 --> 00:06:55.005
What the..

84
00:06:57.013 --> 00:06:58.991
I was feeling a bit screw-loose

85
00:06:59.015 --> 00:07:01.995
so I checked myself in.

86
00:07:02.019 --> 00:07:04.014
Who-who are you?

87
00:07:06.017 --> 00:07:08.013
My card.

88
00:07:10.007 --> 00:07:13.008
'Huh, uh, no! N-no! No! Aah!'

89
00:07:30.023 --> 00:07:33.998
Let me tell you something.
Ol' bats never leaves a trace.

90
00:07:34.022 --> 00:07:37.983
No prints, no follicles,
no match on tire tracks.

91
00:07:38.007 --> 00:07:40.980
- Custom jobs.
- The dude has resources.

92
00:07:41.004 --> 00:07:42.982
And a knack for
showing up where crime is

93
00:07:43.006 --> 00:07:43.985
and police aren't.

94
00:07:44.009 --> 00:07:45.983
I've never laid eyes on him.

95
00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:46.987
Just in.

96
00:07:47.011 --> 00:07:48.979
An unknown perp
released all patients

97
00:07:49.003 --> 00:07:49.999
from the East Wing
of Arkham Asylum.

98
00:07:50.023 --> 00:07:51.995
What? That's crazy!

99
00:07:52.019 --> 00:07:55.018
Crazy enough to lure a bat?

100
00:08:08.009 --> 00:08:08.999
You know, I once
toyed with the idea

101
00:08:09.023 --> 00:08:12.019
of buying the Gators,
buying them lunch.

102
00:08:15.003 --> 00:08:16.017
Oh, Mr. Wayne.

103
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.017
Uh, pardon me, ladies.

104
00:08:23.006 --> 00:08:24.007
Arkham?

105
00:08:25.012 --> 00:08:26.092
'And among Gotham notables'

106
00:08:27.001 --> 00:08:28.989
'we welcome the young
CEO of Wayne Industries'

107
00:08:29.013 --> 00:08:31.992
'Bruce W-Wayne, uh'

108
00:08:32.016 --> 00:08:34.016
'grabbing a Gator
dog, no doubt.'

109
00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.009
No doubt.

110
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.023
Gotta work on those stops.

111
00:09:12.021 --> 00:09:14.004
Whoa!

112
00:09:20.007 --> 00:09:22.004
What the..

113
00:09:26.006 --> 00:09:27.009
Zap.

114
00:09:34.017 --> 00:09:36.014
That was theatrical.

115
00:10:08.022 --> 00:10:11.020
He takes after his
pa, wouldn't you say?

116
00:10:14.018 --> 00:10:15.986
What did you do to him?

117
00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:18.978
Just some laughing gas, drag.

118
00:10:19.002 --> 00:10:22.021
Don't tell me you're
not an inmate.

119
00:10:25.002 --> 00:10:27.989
What rational being
dresses like you?

120
00:10:28.013 --> 00:10:29.979
Speaking of threads

121
00:10:30.003 --> 00:10:30.993
think this is a
good look for me?

122
00:10:31.017 --> 00:10:33.979
- Who are you?
- Joker.

123
00:10:34.003 --> 00:10:36.014
Not what, who?

124
00:10:38.022 --> 00:10:42.007
Smear-free. It's perma-clown.

125
00:10:43.014 --> 00:10:44.987
Ooh, tough crowd.

126
00:10:45.011 --> 00:10:48.987
Look! Nothing up
my sleeves. Ha ha.

127
00:10:49.011 --> 00:10:52.989
Nothing that won't put
a smile on your face.

128
00:10:53.013 --> 00:10:54.022
Say, cheese.

129
00:10:58.023 --> 00:11:00.010
I'm out of gas.

130
00:11:01.012 --> 00:11:03.017
And I'm out of patience!

131
00:11:06.003 --> 00:11:08.981
You really know how to
spoil a coming-out party.

132
00:11:09.005 --> 00:11:10.984
How do you expect me to
spread mirth and whimsy

133
00:11:11.008 --> 00:11:12.985
without a proper hideout?

134
00:11:13.009 --> 00:11:16.982
Listen, Joker, you're
sick! You need help.

135
00:11:17.006 --> 00:11:19.987
Well, maybe I am a little off.

136
00:11:20.011 --> 00:11:21.013
Yah!

137
00:11:23.004 --> 00:11:25.988
But what are you gonna
do, lock me in the looney bin?

138
00:11:26.012 --> 00:11:28.005
I'm already here.

139
00:11:32.013 --> 00:11:33.022
Situation report?

140
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.978
We're rounding up patients
and waiting for choppers

141
00:11:36.002 --> 00:11:37.010
to take us over.

142
00:11:38.019 --> 00:11:40.016
Like we'll get any drier?

143
00:11:41.017 --> 00:11:42.020
Uh.

144
00:11:44.015 --> 00:11:45.983
Huh.

145
00:11:46.007 --> 00:11:48.019
My new partner. Triathlon Whiz.

146
00:11:57.002 --> 00:11:58.993
You know, I really
love this place.

147
00:11:59.017 --> 00:12:01.999
My old hideout's a shambles.

148
00:12:02.023 --> 00:12:03.981
Eyah. He-heh.

149
00:12:04.005 --> 00:12:06.017
And these digs just scream me.

150
00:12:10.004 --> 00:12:11.997
Okay, take back the asylum.

151
00:12:12.021 --> 00:12:18.007
But mark my words, this
town has happy days ahead.

152
00:12:45.017 --> 00:12:48.019
Boing 'Smile, Gotham!'

153
00:12:52.018 --> 00:12:54.020
Well, better split up.

154
00:13:06.021 --> 00:13:09.000
You have the right
to remain silent.

155
00:13:11.014 --> 00:13:14.010
Bennett, spot the perp?

156
00:13:18.006 --> 00:13:19.016
The Bat.

157
00:13:24.011 --> 00:13:26.993
Sir, a stranger in the Batcave?

158
00:13:27.017 --> 00:13:28.997
Tonight, we'll
make an exception.

159
00:13:29.021 --> 00:13:31.991
Oh, my, chap
could use a dentist.

160
00:13:32.015 --> 00:13:34.980
Or a medic.

161
00:13:35.004 --> 00:13:36.015
Right, then.

162
00:13:38.007 --> 00:13:39.993
'Chief Rojas, any
suspects yet in this bizarre'

163
00:13:40.017 --> 00:13:41.988
'jack-in-the-box
hostage incident?'

164
00:13:42.012 --> 00:13:44.022
'I'm not at liberty
to reveal whom.'

165
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.983
'But I feel confident
our best detectives'

166
00:13:47.007 --> 00:13:49.979
'are closing in on
him as we speak.'

167
00:13:50.003 --> 00:13:52.023
And Gotham Gator fan Bruce Wayne

168
00:13:53.001 --> 00:13:54.021
with nary an alibi.

169
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:55.979
How's our patient?

170
00:13:56.003 --> 00:13:56.992
Despite the ghastly grimace

171
00:13:57.016 --> 00:13:57.997
fit as a fiddle.

172
00:13:58.021 --> 00:13:59.985
Poor fellow simply a prisoner

173
00:14:00.009 --> 00:14:01.009
in his own body.

174
00:14:02.023 --> 00:14:03.989
A sample of Joker's gas

175
00:14:04.013 --> 00:14:06.990
is our only hope of
deriving an antidote.

176
00:14:07.014 --> 00:14:09.985
I need to find it
before this madman

177
00:14:10.009 --> 00:14:13.016
puts a permanent
smile on all of Gotham.

178
00:14:15.018 --> 00:14:17.980
'Smile, Gotham!

179
00:14:18.004 --> 00:14:20.014
My old hideout's a shambles.

180
00:14:22.018 --> 00:14:26.979
If I find the old
hideout, I find this Joker.

181
00:14:27.003 --> 00:14:28.984
'Master Bruce,
someone to see you.'

182
00:14:29.008 --> 00:14:31.001
Who is it, Alfred?

183
00:14:33.004 --> 00:14:34.019
The police.

184
00:14:42.008 --> 00:14:44.998
Detective, uh,
am I under arrest?

185
00:14:45.022 --> 00:14:46.985
Yo, Bruce!

186
00:14:47.009 --> 00:14:48.981
Ethan.

187
00:14:49.005 --> 00:14:50.165
Where you've been, my friend?

188
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.005
Master Bruce was at
the Gator game last night.

189
00:14:54.012 --> 00:14:55.993
Speaking of, I
thought we were all set

190
00:14:56.017 --> 00:14:57.984
to shoot some hoops last week.

191
00:14:58.008 --> 00:15:01.011
Ah, I-I've been
buried, Ethan, 24/7.

192
00:15:03.007 --> 00:15:04.993
So, why the sudden visit?

193
00:15:05.017 --> 00:15:07.994
Just... ne-needed
to talk to someone.

194
00:15:08.018 --> 00:15:10.979
Other than the guys
at the station, I mean.

195
00:15:11.003 --> 00:15:12.982
This is gonna
sound weird, Bruce.

196
00:15:13.006 --> 00:15:14.014
But last night..

197
00:15:15.022 --> 00:15:17.007
I saw the Batman.

198
00:15:19.006 --> 00:15:20.995
Only a Ming.

199
00:15:21.019 --> 00:15:22.998
So, he's for real?

200
00:15:23.022 --> 00:15:24.023
What's he look like?

201
00:15:25.001 --> 00:15:25.998
A dude like you or me.

202
00:15:26.022 --> 00:15:28.014
Except he wears Batjamas.

203
00:15:30.008 --> 00:15:30.992
Tough part's this, Bruce.

204
00:15:31.016 --> 00:15:33.983
I really believe the
Bat's helping Gotham.

205
00:15:34.007 --> 00:15:36.978
Even if he is on the
wrong side of the law.

206
00:15:37.002 --> 00:15:37.990
But he's getting a bad rap

207
00:15:38.014 --> 00:15:41.003
and the heat's on
me to take him down.

208
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.004
'Looks like a clown hideout.'

209
00:15:52.007 --> 00:15:54.995
Stop me if you've heard
this one before, Batman.

210
00:15:55.019 --> 00:15:56.979
There were these two fellows

211
00:15:57.003 --> 00:15:58.991
in an abandoned
party favor factory.

212
00:15:59.015 --> 00:16:00.983
One says to the other..

213
00:16:01.007 --> 00:16:02.984
Where are you
keeping the gas, Joker?

214
00:16:03.008 --> 00:16:04.988
You call that a punch line?

215
00:16:05.012 --> 00:16:06.991
I don't share your
sense of humor.

216
00:16:07.015 --> 00:16:08.993
Yet we're linked, you and I.

217
00:16:09.017 --> 00:16:11.023
Like comedy and tragedy.

218
00:16:12.001 --> 00:16:14.022
Two sides, same coin.

219
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:15.990
The gas, Joker

220
00:16:16.014 --> 00:16:18.997
or I vow I will turn
your smile upside-down.

221
00:16:19.021 --> 00:16:22.009
If it's gas you want.

222
00:16:27.012 --> 00:16:30.011
Place all tray tables in
their upright positions.

223
00:16:39.005 --> 00:16:39.999
- What is that?
- Ah.

224
00:16:40.023 --> 00:16:44.991
- It looks like a balloon.
- Smiles, people. Smiles!

225
00:16:45.015 --> 00:16:47.995
The balloon's
filled with Joker gas.

226
00:16:48.019 --> 00:16:50.019
'And he's gonna pop it.'

227
00:16:52.001 --> 00:16:53.018
Over Gotham.

228
00:17:04.002 --> 00:17:06.982
A balloon downtown
this time of year? That's...

229
00:17:07.006 --> 00:17:09.020
Crazy? I'll drive.

230
00:17:18.004 --> 00:17:18.993
If you're loving me

231
00:17:19.017 --> 00:17:22.006
wait till you get
a load of my pop.

232
00:17:32.019 --> 00:17:35.023
- Stop this thing, Joker.
- With what brakes?

233
00:17:38.013 --> 00:17:39.019
He-ah!

234
00:17:44.023 --> 00:17:48.011
It's the Batman. And
he's pummeling a clown.

235
00:17:49.011 --> 00:17:51.000
- Ugh!
- Aah!

236
00:17:52.012 --> 00:17:53.991
The jack-in-the-box, Yin.

237
00:17:54.015 --> 00:17:56.996
What if clowny's the one
behind the Arkham incident?

238
00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:58.993
Explain the missing orderly.

239
00:17:59.017 --> 00:18:01.990
Maybe Bats took him
'cause.. Uh, I don't know.

240
00:18:02.014 --> 00:18:03.985
Uh, the guy needed
help or something.

241
00:18:04.009 --> 00:18:05.981
Fair enough. We're
chasing two perps.

242
00:18:06.005 --> 00:18:09.004
One's a criminal. The
other's still a vigilante.

243
00:18:13.012 --> 00:18:15.014
Watch your pinkies.

244
00:18:20.014 --> 00:18:21.016
Whoa.

245
00:18:31.002 --> 00:18:32.015
East. Gotham Bay.

246
00:18:35.003 --> 00:18:37.997
You have made me
one very sad clown!

247
00:18:38.021 --> 00:18:40.986
You.. Where'd you go?

248
00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:44.020
- Knock-knock.
- Who's there?

249
00:19:04.021 --> 00:19:06.002
Ah!

250
00:19:21.015 --> 00:19:24.000
Boing boing boing.

251
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.003
My precious gas
passed by a party pooper.

252
00:19:42.023 --> 00:19:45.015
I had a different
punch line in mind.

253
00:19:54.023 --> 00:19:56.985
'Well, we can
take the clown in.'

254
00:19:57.009 --> 00:19:59.014
I know you love to swim.

255
00:20:00.022 --> 00:20:02.986
Alfred, move our
houseguest out of the Batcave

256
00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:06.019
and prep the lab. I have
an antidote to whip up.

257
00:20:11.016 --> 00:20:13.979
Steiner, check.

258
00:20:14.003 --> 00:20:15.989
McSwain, check.

259
00:20:16.013 --> 00:20:19.005
223, new arrival.

260
00:20:20.005 --> 00:20:21.018
Check.

261
00:20:23.009 --> 00:20:25.982
They all said I was
sick in the head.

262
00:20:26.006 --> 00:20:27.995
They said I needed help.

263
00:20:28.019 --> 00:20:30.999
Well, maybe I am a bit batty.

264
00:20:31.023 --> 00:20:35.011
Blame it on the
Bats in my belfry.

265
00:21:02.018 --> 00:21:04.017
